1) Entity class completed with object methods 
2) Inhertiance ( resusablity ) 
3) Is-A Relation ship 
4) Run time polymorphism 
5) Final Keyword 

Any class written in Java will have Object ( available class ) as super class 

Object is printed 
com.htc.day3.Book@15db9742
packagename.classname@memoryaddress


How do I print details of the object ? using toString() - available in Object 


@Override
public String toString() {
	return "Book [bookId....=" + bookId + ", bookName----=" + bookName + ", bookPrice=" + bookPrice + "]";
}

The above method is called automatically , when i try to print the detail of the object 


1) hashCode and equals method are interrelated with each other 
2) hashCode is meant for refering the memory where the object is stored 
3) equals method is meant for comparing two objects 
4) equals method will return true if hashcode of 2 objects are same.
5) every object will have unique hashcode 


equals method is widely used if u need to sort ( compare and swap ) and conclude 


employee as child class , what could be the better parent class for this ?



department,company,organization,person,manager,HR,PayRoll,Team,facilities,BusinessUnit

<childclassname> Is-A <parentclassname>

employee Is-A department ( wrong ) 

employee Is-A Person 

Is-a Relation ship is inheritance 


Final variable   -- cannot be changed 
Final Method     -- cannot be overridden 
Final class      -- cannot be inherited
