1) Class name should be prefarably NOUN ,singular( product , employee....) 
2) Do not have input phase ( read statement ) inside the class ( should be in main method ) 
3) Do not have output phase ( write statement ) inside the class ( should be in main method ) 
4) class must have validation phase , Business logic 


Entity classes

2) public constructors

Construtors 

Class name and construtor name are same
nature is usually public
it can be overloded 
it is meant for input phase 
it gets fired ( called )  automatically when an object is created 
constructor is fired only once
constructor will not have return type


Why do we need setters if we have constructors ?

Both constructors , setters are meant for input phase 

Id,name,Price 

for intializing first time we can use constructor 

If I need to update the inputs use setters
